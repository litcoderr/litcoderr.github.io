> Being the first post from this blog, it means alot. I would like to address the reason why I am starting this whole blog thing.

## 1. The 3 Reasons
### 1) Promotion
If you are looking for jobs or even a group of people to develop with, some kind of resume is essential. For many others including me, github was where my works would be stored. Nonetheless I needed a platform to organize those works and promote them to the public who might be interrested.<br>
From today on, this [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/litdevblog/?modal=admin_todo_tour) would become the main advertisement stream that would lead to this blog where my works would be organized and be told in literature.

### 2) Organize
I usually have several projects going on at the same time which eventually becomes a total kaos. By maintaing this blog, my exepectation is to be on track of my projects and organize them more often.

### 3) Motivation
This blog would give me some kind of responsibility and get me going even on the worst days.

## 2. Today's Recap
> Just a simple disclaimer: I will post a daily blog every day with "daily" tag and "Today's Recap" sub title. It would be a section of daily dev diary going through each day's work and feelings. <br>
