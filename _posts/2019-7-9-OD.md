> In this post, we will go through major fast object detection algorithm such as (SSD, YOLO, RetinaNet). You will be able to understand the basic algorithm and apply those algorithm in real use cases. To do so, I will try to be as concise as possible.

## Basic Concept of One-Stage Detectors
They skip region proposal stage and run directly over a dense sampling feature maps. This method may lack accuracy wich is a trade-off for speed.

## 1. YOLO (You only look once)

### Algorithm
1. Input : Image [W *H *C]
2. Hidden Stage : Uses Darknet to extract usefull features
3. Ouput : Box and Class Prediction [S * S(number of region)* (Number of boxes for this region)* (4(x,y,w,h)+1(probability)+(Number of Class))]
- There are S * S number of regions where boundaries are going to be predicted
- For each region, for each box, (location of the box, probability of location, probability of class prediction) are predicted
- Confidence score can be calcuted by (probability of location * probability of class prediction)

### Training

### Downsides
- Limited detection boxes for each region. There for hard to detect close by objects
- Shape of bounding boxes are also learned. Will not work on edge cases.

## 2. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)

### Algorithm
1. Input : Image [W* H* C]
2. Hidden Stage: Uses VGG_16 to extract features
- Same as YOLO except predict from every extra convolutional layer
3. Ouput : Appended hidden state output

### Downsides
- Same as YOLO
- Since calculating for each feature map, higher the computation cost
