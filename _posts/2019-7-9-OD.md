In this post, we will go through major fast object detection algorithm such as (SSD, YOLO, RetinaNet). You will be able to understand the basic algorithm and apply those algorithm in real use cases. To do so, I will try to be as concise as possible.
## Basic Concept of One-Stage Detectors
They skip region proposal stage and run directly over a dense sampling feature maps. This method may lack accuracy wich is a trade-off for speed.
## SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
