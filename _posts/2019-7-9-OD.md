In this post, we will go through major fast object detection algorithm such as (SSD, YOLO, RetinaNet). You will be able to understand the basic algorithm and apply those algorithm in real use cases. To do so, I will try to be as concise as possible.
## Basic Concept of One-Stage Detectors
They skip region proposal stage and run directly over a dense sampling feature maps. This method may lack accuracy wich is a trade-off for speed.
## 1. SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)

## 2. YOLO (You only look once)

### Algorithm
1. Input : Image [[W*H*C]]
2. Hidden Stage : Uses Darknet to extract usefull features
3. Ouput : Box and Class Prediction [[S*S(number of region)*(Number of boxes for this region)*(4(x,y,w,h)+1(probability)+(Number of Class))]]
- There are S * S number of regions where boundaries are going to be predicted
- For each region, for each boxes, (location of the box, probability of location, probability of class prediction)
- Confidence score can be calcuted by (probability of location * probability of class prediction)
